# 2017 Javascript Final Project

The final project from my first Javascript class taken in undergrad at the University of Miami.

## Purpose

I wanted to create an interactive way to post travel blogs on my personal website. I decided to create an SVG map that would allow me to feature various blog posts by categorizing them by state. 

## Code

This project was built using pure Javascript.
