Final Project

Modifications since class presentation:

Fixed two major bugs-
 1) A second map image (the original SVG) kept appearing underneath the modified SVG. I finally figured out how to "detangle" the modifications from this original SVG and delete it.

 2) Instead of appearing once a state was clicked, the info box was appearing right when the page was uploaded. I had a surprisingly difficult time figuring out how to solve this. I ended up using display.

 Added CSS design-
  now it is slightly more visually appealing.

 Next step-
 While I'm proud of the bugs I've fixed this past week, my time was spent fixing the bugs rather than exploring options for image placement. In my code I started playing around with some different approaches. This summer I plan on adding a img div to the right of the map; when a state is clicked, corresponding images will appear in the div.

 I look forward to working on this interactive project more this summer so that it can eventually replace my old, outdated mini blog on my website.
